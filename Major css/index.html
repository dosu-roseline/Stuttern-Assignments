            <b>I love technology</b> because it’s the triumph of the human
            intellect. The more I study and understand technology, the more I
            feel that nothing in the universe is out of reach. There’s even a
            great rush of power that comes from coding your first simple “Hello
            World” program. Getting it to run successfully, seeing those two
            words on the screen and knowing that YOU put them there just makes
            you think of the endless possibilities…

            <b>CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used for website
            layout in design and used alongside HTML. <b>CSS</b> is a styling
            language. <b>CSS</b> consists of three types or methods which
            includes: 1. <b>In Line CSS - </b> one add CSS styling in the
            opening tag of the HTML Elements as a style attribute. 2.
            <b>Internal CSS Styling - </b> CSS can be added using style tag
            within the html file but inside of the head element just right after
            the title tag, this is done in order for the browser to load all
            styling into memory before creating the DOM. 3.
            <b>External CSS Styling - </b>
            An external file is used to define the styling in this method for
            any HTML page, This method of styling can be used by more than one
            HTML page, To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the
            head section of each HTML page.

            <b>-</b> More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to
            use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to
            all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.

            <b>-</b> CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also
            allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in
            logical places and well organized, user experience improves.

            <b>-</b>With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles
            to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style sheet
            can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance,
            you have product pages that should all have the same formatting,
            look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all
            pages of that same type.

            pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices.
            Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines
            with HTML to make responsive design possible.</i

            <b>-</b> If you need to change the format of a specific set of
            pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every
            individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and
            you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that
            style sheet.

            <b>Border</b> This is used to set the border on an element. The CSS
            border properties (border-style, border-color, border-width and

            <b>Padding</b> refers to the space between the element content and
            the element border. The CSS padding properties are used to generate
            space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
            With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are
            properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top,
            right, bottom, and left).
